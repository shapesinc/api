# DreamLens x Shapes API Integration

**DreamLens** is a web-based AI app for dream journaling and emotional insight. Users write down dreams in their own words and receive supportive, therapeutic reflections.

We use AI not to decode symbols, but to reflect how the dream *feels* â€” creating space for emotional clarity, pattern recognition, and personal growth.

## Why Shapes?

The Shapes API lets us create a more emotionally intelligent dream guide. Our Shape reflects tone, tracks recurring themes, and feels like a warm presence over time â€” not just a chatbot.

This demo shows how we send user dream entries into the Shapes API to receive personalized, calming responses.
