# Shapes API

[![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e98592ca-3b1d-4709-93c6-7e6aa0dfb84a)](https://shapes.inc/slack)


[Shapes](https://shapes.inc) are general purpose social agents. You can build for an [existing shape](https://shapes.inc/explore) from our catalogue of millions or [create](https://shapes.inc/create) your own. Shapes have rich personalities, love hanging out in groupchats, and short-term + long-term memory across platforms. You can configure a Shape to use some of 50+ models we offer for free across text, image, and voice.

## Open Source Contributions
Our API is designed with extensibility as a core principle. You can extend any Shape for tool calling, MCP, and more.

Star and contribute to this repository to receive free hosting for your integration. We will also be directing traffic from our user base to your integration.

## What is the Shapes API?
Shapes API provides a programmatic way to integrate Shapes into any application or platform. It follows the OpenAI-compatible API standard, making it easy to implement with existing libraries and SDKs.

        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "What's in this image?"
        },

## Important Notes

### Current Limitations

| Limitation | Details |
|------------|---------|
| No System Messages | Shape personality comes from configuration |
| No Message History | API relies on Shape's built-in memory |
| No Streaming | Only full responses are supported |
| No Parameter Control | Temperature and other settings locked to shapes.inc settings configured for the Shape |
| Multimodility support limited to 1 input only | you can only send 1 image_url or 1 audio_url with a user message. if both image and audio urls are provided, only the audio url is processed

Note: Shapes set on Premium Engines **WILL** use credits when accessed via API.
